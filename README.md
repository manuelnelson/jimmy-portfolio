## Getting started
1. Fork and clone repository
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'npm start' to start the webpack front-end, or even more preferably run 'npm run combine' to start up the backend server with the front-end. Make sure your Mongo instance is up and running.

##Tech Stack
1. Database - MongoDb
2. Backend - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. [Keystone](keystonejs.com/) as CMS 
4. Front-end uses [Webpack v2](https://webpack.js.org/) and soon to be [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) with Typescript.
